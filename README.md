# Dog-Prediction
_It's an Udacity project_

## Descrpiton
In this project after uploding images, the algorithm basically runs the image and let's us know what kind of dog breed it is.

There were many dog and human images which basically runs any image and if the image is dog it predicts what kind of breed it is, if the image is human image it basically tells _Your a human_ but looks like some kind of dog breed.

For detailed idea about the code refer to one of the .ipynb file or .html to know how the code basically runs and provides the output.
